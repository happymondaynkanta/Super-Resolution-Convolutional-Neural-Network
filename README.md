# Super-Resolution-Convolutional-Neural-Network
Super-resolution is the task of constructing a higher-resolution image from a lower-resolution image.
## Introduction
Image super-resolution (SR) is the process of recovering high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) images. It is an important class of image processing techniques in computer vision and image processing and enjoys a wide range of real-world applications, such as medical imaging, satellite imaging, surveillance and security, astronomical imaging, amongst others.
